Analyze Adsbexchange data to identify coverage dropouts. Long term end goal is to create something that could be used to identify hi priority locations for additional coverage, and to provide maps covering different message types, altitudes, etc to enrich that analyse.

This project is just for fun and mostly serves as an excuse to play with some new to me modules.
